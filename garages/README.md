# Garages

Garage sessions were selected by popular vote from a series of submissions from the community. The list of submissions can be [found here](http://call4paperz.com/events/gdg-summit-2015-gdg-garage-projects).

The **top 5 vote-getters** were accepted and scheduled on Day 2 (Wednesday) in Green Room 1 (G1). The selected proposals are listed below (in abstract). Each garage has its own dedicated section to capture notes from that section.

#### **WTM Apps Family: Android, Glass .. and what will be next?**

*Kseniia Shumelchyk (GDG Dnipropetrovsk)*

**Abstract**:

Women Techmakers app makes it easier to discover WTM content while being on the go. The WTM app allows to find speakers, to see their skills and topics that they could talk about, also allows to become a speaker. As well app shows the list of programs dedicated to women in technologies, past and upcoming events (with notifications) and links to official resources. We'll talk about app extensions :)

#### **H20 Heroes**

*Jim Hutson (GDG Modesto)*

**Abstract**: The Western US is in a severe drought. H2O Heroes gamifies water conservation with social media integration for Heroes to share their water conservation stories, photos, and tips. (something like untappd for water savers) I would love this to be a collaboration among GDGers in the region (and across the globe!) [optional] Publicly shame those water wasters (vilains!) hosing down the driveway.

#### **GDG Attendance Counter**
*Etienne Caron (GDG Montreal Android)*

**Abstract**: 

Keeping track of headcount during an event is painful. If you use a combination of various ticketing systems (Meetup/Eventbrite/Google Dev Site/G+ Event) you can't really rely on any single one to give you good numbers. Our GDG (Montreal Android) is working on an app to try and address this issue, where users sign up with their fave identity platform, and register on-site. Want to help?

#### **GDG Wisdom Jam**
*Nitya Narasimhan (GDG New York, GDG Hudson Valley)*

**Abstract**: 

GDG Wisdom is an initiative to capture and share community knowledge to make starting, running and growing GDGs easier. The first release (a website: http://bit.ly/gdg-wisdom-site) faced challenges in automating contributions and accreditation. We solved this with GitBook (http://bit.ly/gdg-wisdom-book) in 2015. This is a hands-on working session to migrate & add Wisdom content to GitBook!

#### **Make a LAN mirror of everything you need to develop Android Apps**
*Derek Grant (GDG ??)*

**Abstract**:

Do you want more bandwidth for your Android Fundamentals Study Jams? Yes, you do. Android Studio, SDK Manager, and the recommended version of JDK. Itâ€™s a lot to download, not to mention the SDK packages waiting for you in Android SDK Manager. GDG Suzhou will show you how to save your bandwidth by making everything available on LAN.
