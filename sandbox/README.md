# Sandbox (Process)

GDG Wisdom is structured as chapters and sections. Each chapter has a "page" that describes the purpose of that chapter.

A chapter can have many sections, with each section allocated its own "page". Thus, editing a chapter's purpose, or a section's content, is as simple as editing the relevant *page.*

The current GitBook structure involves having a separate **directory** for each chapter, and a unique **file** within that directory, for each section.

Since the naming and hierarchical implications of this are fairly important, we prefer that requests to create these be submitted to GDG Wisdom editors (in lieu of creating them yourselves).

This also prevents us having to deal with inadvertent duplicates or redundant chapters and sections being created concurrently by different members.

You can request a new chapter, or a new section in a chapter, by [filing an Issue on our GitHub page](https://github.com/gdg-wisdom/2015-gdg-global-summit). Alternatively, just edit this Sandbox page and create a pull request.
