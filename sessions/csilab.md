# Day1: CSI:Lab

This was a hands-on lab about prototyping with ice-breaker
"rock, paper, scissors".

**brainstorming:** Focus on quantity of ideas, not quality at the moment. We'll come to that later. We need more ideas, crazy ideas, 10x ideas. Everyone comes up with as many ideas as one could.


**prototype:**
paper / pencil,
clickable,
video,
drawing.
Don't tell. Show with ur prototype


**test:**
Find someone new from other groups to test your prototype.

## Hints
While interviewing: talk only 20% of the time. listen 80%. 20/80
